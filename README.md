### Vehicle Information
When you position your cursor over a vehicle, the info panel shows:
- Vehicle type and specifications
- Current position and state (Idle/Moving/Loading/etc.)
- Age, reliability, and maintenance status
- Financial performance (profit, deliveries)
- Capacity and current cargo

## Technical Architecture

### Modules
- `game.rs`: Main game loop and state management
- `world.rs`: Map generation, terrain, cities, and industries
- `ui.rs`: Terminal user interface using Ratatui
- `player.rs`: Player company management and statistics
- `vehicle.rs`: Vehicle types, movement, and cargo handling
- `economy.rs`: Market simulation and pricing
- `ai.rs`: AI opponent logic and decision making
- `save.rs`: Game save and load functionality

### Dependencies
- **crossterm**: Cross-platform terminal manipulation
- **ratatui**: Rich terminal user interface framework
- **serde**: Serialization for save/load system
- **rand**: Random number generation for world generation

## Building and Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd RustroverProjects/RusTTD

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the game
cargo run --release
```

## Development Status

This is a complete working implementation with:
- âœ… Core game architecture
- âœ… Terminal UI with map navigation
- âœ… World generation with cities and industries  
- âœ… Economic simulation
- âœ… Vehicle and route management systems
- âœ… AI opponent system
- âœ… Save/load functionality
- âœ… Interactive build menu and construction system
- âœ… Railway tracks, roads, stations, and vehicle purchasing
- ðŸ”„ Route assignment and vehicle automation (planned)
- ðŸ”„ More vehicle types and advanced routes (planned)
- ðŸ”„ Campaign mode and scenarios (planned)

## Game Concepts

### Transport Chain Example
1. **Coal Mine** produces coal
2. **Train** transports coal to **Steel Mill**
3. **Steel Mill** converts coal + iron ore to steel
4. **Truck** delivers steel to **Factory**
5. **Factory** produces goods for **Cities**

### Profitability Factors
- **Distance**: Longer routes = higher profits
- **Demand**: High-demand cargo pays more
- **Speed**: Faster delivery = better reputation
- **Efficiency**: Full loads maximize income
- **Economic Conditions**: Boom times increase all prices

### AI Behavior
- **Easy AI**: Slower decision making, smaller starting capital
- **Medium AI**: Balanced approach with moderate capital
- **Hard AI**: Aggressive expansion with large starting funds
- **Strategy Types**:
  - Aggressive: Quick expansion, high-capacity vehicles
  - Conservative: Focuses on profitable existing routes
  - Balanced: Mix of expansion and optimization
  - Specialist: Focuses on specific cargo types
